I am currently studying in Ritsumeikan Asia Paciffic University in Japan. My major is management, but I am not a rich guy and I am always losing money.
Currently I got those licenses (I am those kind of people who regard taking licenses as a hobby): 
  Japanese Level Proficiency Test N1
  C1 Driving licence in China
  Information Security Management in Japan (情報セキュリティマネジメント) 
 I am looking forward to take:
  Applied Information Technology Engineer in Japan (応用情報技術者)
  Basic Information Technology Engineer in Japan (基本情報技術者)
(I am not really good at coding, but maybe I can offer you some experiences in...language studies and taking some licenses?)

Chinese, English and Japanese are all Ok.
